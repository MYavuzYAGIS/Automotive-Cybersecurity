# MODULE 1 Analyzing Network Protocols With Wireshark 

Packet that Matters:

 Best way to begin capturing network traffic is collecting our analysis on a span mirror port on a switch near the client.

 This will help to keep the traffic flowing and to avoid the traffic being captured by the switch hence making it smaller and easier to analyze.


 Another way to create a smaller haystack is to filter the captured traffic to only the traffic that is relevant to the analysis.


We create custom columns, protocols, and custom filters to help us analyze the traffic.

Also saving protocol filterings as button for the quick access to those filters.


## **Core Protocols**

Under the application data there are :

- UDP
- TCP
- IPV4
- IPV6
- ARP
- ICMP
- DNS
- TLS
