TIMELY MAIL:

Here are some topics that can be covered on technical interview:

Regarding Security: (Since you come from networking/security background these will be the main points Technica will value for your profile)

The expectation is to know the IPsec protocols like IKE, AH, ESP and most of all being able to read (understand) and analyse the traces/packets in order to find a root cause of a problem.
Have some knowledge about TLS, Macsec, Firewalling.
IPsec VPN Tunneling
Example questions: What is the difference between routing and switching, how a switch knows where to send the package, which protocols are needed to establish IPsec connection etc.
Regarding Ethernet:

The expectation is to know well the ethernet protocols like TCP/IP, UDP, DHCP etc. and most of all being able to read (understand) and analyse the traces/packets in order to find a root cause of a problem.
Threre can be questions regarding the ISO OSI model, protocol headers.
The knowledge of Some/IP protocol will be an asset (nice to know).
Regarding programming:

Some basic programming/automation knowledge is required.
Example topics that can be covered: Data structure, OOP paradigms, programming patterns.
Regarding automotive and testing: (These ones are of course optionoal since you donâ€™t have an automotive/testing background, so these are just nice to know ðŸ˜Š)

Some knowledge from "ISTQB foundation level" is expected, eg. what is the difference between functional and non-functional testing or verification and validation.
Ability to analyze traces/packets and differentiate BUS systems like CAN/CAN-FD, LIN, Flexray
knowledge of General E/E architecture,
V-Model
DTC
Flashing.
 

If you have any questions or you need help, please do not hesitate to contact me!

I hope that all will be successful, we keep our fingers crossed for you and wish you good luck in the interview!
