### **What is IpSec?**


RFC 6071(IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Document Roadmap)

IPsec is a protocol that provides a secure tunnel between two computers. It is used to protect data that is transmitted over the internet. 

IPsec helps mitigation against:

- eavesdropping

- theft

- replay attacks,

- Data corruption.

Ipsec operates in 2 different modes: tunnel mode and transport mode.

In ***tunnel mode***, everything is encapsulated in IPsec datagram. when data is transmitted, the layer 3 devices only use IPsec header to route the packet.

This is used basically in the site-to-site VPN and remote access VPN.

in ***transport mode***, all of the data is protected but the original IP header is not. Payload is protected by IPsec. This is used generally in P2P applications.
