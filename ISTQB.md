Planning for testing is the most important part of testing.

Difference of Vocabularies:

**Quality Assurance**: Adherence to process, it is` proactive and prevents`, are we doing the right thing

**Quality Control**: Testing, test design, test execution. `Reactive and detects`. So Testing lives IN the quality Control.

Main umbrella is Quality Management, under which is QA, under which is QC, under which is Testing.


Error, Defect, and Failure are not the same thing.

Error is a mistake. lets say customer and software team are not on the same page on understanding stuff.

Defect is Bug. It is a mistake `in the software.`

A bug(defect) may or may not lead to the failure of a software product.

Failure is simply an observable defect.

These should be caught in testing.


### <u>**7 Testing Principles**</u>

- Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.
- Exhaustive testing is impossible, nor practical. An important sampling and testing on it is smart choice.
- Early testing saves money and time.
- Defects cluster together(1 cause another)
- Pesticide Paradox: To find new bugs, you need to make reviews and changes to the test.
- Testing is content dependent. Which app requires more security testing.
- Absence of error is fallacy. Meaning even if you catch tons of defects, you cannot guarantee there is not anymore.
