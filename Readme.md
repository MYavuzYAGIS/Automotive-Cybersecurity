# <u>What is This Repo?</u>

This repository contains my personal handwritten notes on `Automotive Cybersecurity`, `Automotive Ethernet Protocols`, and `Network Diagnosis & Protocols`.

## <u>Origin?</u>

I used various online resources to compile this repository including leading publishing houses.

Secondly, I used pluralsight expert and deepDive courses.

Thirdly, I used field-expert talks and conferences on YouTube.

Finally, I used official documentations and other sources.

## <u>What is it in here?</u>

I have compiled the following topics:

- Network protocols like Arp, IP, TCP/IP, TLS, SSH..

- Automotive Ethernet Protocols like SecOC, Key Management, Vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems, etc.

- Automotive Network Systems like CAN, LIN, FlexRay, etc.

- Wireshark and other tools for network analysis.

- IDS/IPS for ethernet & CanBus.

- Some Reference Books.
